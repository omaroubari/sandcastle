## Core concepts

| Term           | Definition                                                                                                                    | Aliases to avoid                                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sandcastle** | The TypeScript CLI tool that orchestrates AI coding agents inside isolated environments                                       | "the tool", "the CLI", "RALPH"                                                          |
| **Sandbox**    | An isolated environment where an agent executes code — a Docker container with the **worktree** bind-mounted as the workspace | "container" (too specific), "Docker sandbox" (ambiguous with Claude's built-in feature) |
| **Host**       | The developer's machine where Sandcastle runs and the real git repo lives                                                     | "local" (ambiguous — the sandbox also has a local filesystem)                           |
| **Agent**      | The AI coding tool invoked inside the sandbox (e.g. Claude Code, Codex)                                                       | "RALPH", "the bot", "Claude" (too specific — agent is swappable)                        |

## Environment

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                           | Aliases to avoid                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Env resolver** | The module that loads environment variables from `.env` files and `process.env`, returning a generic key-value map                   | "token resolver" (too specific to auth tokens) |
| **Env manifest** | The agent provider's declaration of which environment variables it requires or supports, used to scaffold `.env.example`             | "env example", "env template", "env schema"    |
| **Env check**    | The agent provider's validation function that inspects the resolved env map and fails with a clear error if requirements are not met | "token validation", "env validation"           |

## Execution

| Term                             | Definition                                                                                                                           | Aliases to avoid                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Iteration**                    | A single invocation of the agent inside the sandbox, producing at most one commit against one task                                   | "run" (ambiguous with the CLI command), "cycle", "loop"                                  |
| **Task**                         | A GitHub issue that the agent selects and works on during an iteration                                                               | "job", "work item", "ticket"                                                             |
| **Completion signal**            | The `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` marker in the agent's output indicating all actionable tasks are finished                          | "done flag", "exit signal"                                                               |
| **Orchestrator**                 | The module that drives the iteration loop: invoke agent, check for commits, check completion signal, repeat                          | "runner", "loop", "wrapper script"                                                       |
| **Prompt**                       | The instruction text passed to the agent at the start of each iteration — may contain **prompt arguments** and **shell expressions** | "system prompt" (too specific), "instructions" (too vague), "message"                    |
| **Prompt argument**              | A named key-value pair passed via `promptArgs` in `run()` that substitutes a `{{KEY}}` placeholder in a **prompt**                   | "prompt variable" (ambiguous with env vars), "template variable", "parameter"            |
| **Prompt argument substitution** | The preprocessing step that replaces all `{{KEY}}` placeholders in a **prompt** with values from the **prompt arguments** map        | "template expansion", "interpolation", "variable substitution"                           |
| **Prompt expansion**             | The preprocessing step that finds and evaluates all **shell expressions** in a **prompt** before passing it to the agent             | "prompt preprocessing" (too generic), "command expansion"                                |
| **Shell expression**             | A `` !`command` `` marker in a **prompt** that evaluates a shell command inside the sandbox and is replaced with its stdout          | "command" (overloaded — collides with hook commands), "inline command", "prompt command" |

## Project structure

| Term                 | Definition                                                                                                                 | Aliases to avoid                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Config directory** | The `.sandcastle/` directory in a host repo containing sandbox configuration: Dockerfile, prompt, config, and env settings | ".sandcastle folder", "sandcastle dir" |
| **Init**             | The CLI command that scaffolds the **config directory** in a host repo and builds the Docker image                         | "create", "bootstrap", "new"           |
| **Build-image**      | The CLI command that rebuilds the Docker image from an existing **config directory**                                       | "setup-sandbox" (old name)             |
| **Remove-image**     | The CLI command that removes the Docker image                                                                              | "cleanup-sandbox" (old name)           |

## Architecture

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                      | Aliases to avoid       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Sandbox service** | The Effect service interface exposing `exec`, `copyIn`, and `copyOut` operations against a sandbox                                                                              | "adapter", "transport" |
| **Worktree**        | A git worktree created in `.sandcastle/worktrees/` on the **host**, bind-mounted into the **sandbox** container as the agent's working directory — eliminates the need for sync | "branch copy", "clone" |

## Relationships

- **Sandcastle** orchestrates an **agent** inside a **sandbox**
- A **sandbox** is a Docker container backed by a **worktree** bind-mounted at the workspace path, implementing the **Sandbox service** interface
- The **worktree** is bind-mounted into the **sandbox** container, so the agent writes directly to the **host** filesystem — no sync operations are needed
- Each **iteration** may produce one or more commits; iterations repeat until the **completion signal** fires or the max count is reached
- **Init** creates the **config directory** on the **host** and builds the Docker image
- **Build-image** requires the **config directory** to already exist on the **host**
- The **env resolver** loads env vars from: repo root `.env` > **config directory** `.env` > `process.env` — only keys declared in a `.env` file are resolved from `process.env`
- Each **agent provider** declares an **env manifest** and an **env check**
- The **agent provider** is selected via the `agent` field in config or `--agent` CLI flag
- At launch, Sandcastle resolves env vars via the **env resolver**, runs the active **agent provider**'s **env check**, then passes the full env map into the **sandbox**
- **Init** uses the **agent provider**'s **env manifest** to scaffold `.env.example` and its Dockerfile template to scaffold the Dockerfile
- **Prompt argument substitution** runs once after prompt resolution, replacing `{{KEY}}` placeholders with values from **prompt arguments** — this happens on the **host**, before the **sandbox** exists
- **Prompt expansion** runs before each **iteration**, evaluating all **shell expressions** inside the **sandbox**
- **Prompt argument substitution** runs before **prompt expansion**, so **prompt arguments** can inject values into **shell expressions**
- A `{{KEY}}` placeholder with no matching **prompt argument** is an error; unused **prompt arguments** produce a warning
- A **prompt** may contain zero or more **prompt arguments** and/or **shell expressions**; each substitution step is skipped if there are no matches

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "What if I want to add support for OpenCode instead of Claude Code?"

> **Domain expert:** "Create a new **agent provider**. It declares its own **env manifest** — maybe it needs `OPEN_CODE_TOKEN` instead of `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Its **env check** validates those requirements. And it provides its own Dockerfile template that installs the right binary."

> **Dev:** "How does Sandcastle know which **agent provider** to use?"

> **Domain expert:** "The `agent` field in `config.json`, or the `--agent` CLI flag. The **env resolver** loads all env vars generically — it doesn't know or care which **agent** is running. The **agent provider**'s **env check** is what enforces the tool-specific requirements."

> **Dev:** "I want to reuse the same **prompt** file for multiple issues in parallel. How do I pass the issue number in?"

> **Domain expert:** "Use **prompt arguments**. Put `{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}` in the **prompt** file, then pass `promptArgs: { ISSUE_NUMBER: 42 }` to `run()`. **Prompt argument substitution** replaces it before anything else runs."

> **Dev:** "What if I also have a **shell expression** that uses the issue number — like `` !`gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}}` ``?"

> **Domain expert:** "That works. **Prompt argument substitution** runs first on the **host**, so `{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}` becomes `42` everywhere — including inside **shell expressions**. Then **prompt expansion** evaluates the **shell expression** inside the **sandbox**."

> **Dev:** "What happens if I typo the key — like `{{ISSUE_NUBMER}}`?"

> **Domain expert:** "**Prompt argument substitution** fails with an error. Every `{{KEY}}` in the **prompt** must have a matching **prompt argument**. The reverse is just a warning — unused **prompt arguments** don't block execution."

> **Dev:** "So the **agent** never sees `{{...}}` or `` !`...` `` syntax?"

> **Domain expert:** "Correct. By the time the **prompt** reaches the **agent**, both substitution steps have run and replaced everything with concrete values."

## Flagged ambiguities

- **"Docker sandbox"** — In this project, **sandbox** refers to our isolated environment concept. It is NOT Claude Code's built-in `docker sandbox` CLI feature. Use **sandbox** for ours; spell out "Claude's Docker sandbox CLI" for the built-in feature.
- **"Container"** vs **"Sandbox"** — "Container" is the Docker primitive; **sandbox** is our abstraction over it. Use **sandbox** when talking about the concept, "container" only when discussing Docker implementation details.
- **"Local"** vs **"Host"** — Both could mean the developer's machine, but "local" is ambiguous (the **worktree** is also on a local filesystem). Use **host** to mean the developer's machine. Reserve "local" for generic contexts.
- **"Run"** — Ambiguous between the CLI command (`sandcastle run`) and a single **iteration**. Use **iteration** for one agent invocation; use "run command" or "run session" for the CLI command that drives multiple iterations.
- **"Token"** vs **"Env var"** — The old `TokenResolver` name implied it only handled auth tokens. The **env resolver** handles all environment variables generically. Use "env var" for the general concept; "token" only when referring specifically to an auth credential value.
- **"Command"** — Heavily overloaded: hook commands, shell commands, CLI commands, **shell expressions**. Use **shell expression** for the `` !`...` `` syntax in **prompts**; use "hook" for lifecycle hooks; use "CLI command" for `sandcastle run`, `sandcastle init`, etc.
- **"Variable"** vs **"Argument"** — Env vars and **prompt arguments** are both key-value pairs, but they serve different purposes. **Prompt arguments** are host-side values substituted into `{{KEY}}` placeholders. Env vars are passed into the **sandbox** environment. Don't call prompt arguments "variables" or "template variables".
